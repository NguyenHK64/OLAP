In the modern context, the aviation industry has become an essential part of the global economy and daily life. However, from August 2019 to August 2023, the industry has faced many serious challenges, especially the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a significant increase in flight delays and cancellations. These issues have not only inconvenienced millions of passengers but also deeply affected the image and operations of airlines.

Understanding the difficulties and opportunities during this period, our group decided to choose the topic of building a Flight Data Warehouse. This data warehouse will not only help airlines and management agencies monitor and analyze operational performance but also provide insights into the causes and trends of flight delays and cancellations. From there, we hope to be able to propose practical measures to optimize operational processes, improve service quality and improve passenger experience in the future.
